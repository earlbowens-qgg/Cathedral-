# Quantum Gate Grid (QGG)

**Quantum Gate Grid (QGG)** is a dual‑mode orchestrator harness that gates every mutation through **public‑safe** and **private‑secure** channels, sealing artifacts for inheritance and enterprise‑scale resilience.

---

## 🌌 Core Premise
Every artifact, mutation, and decision must pass through a **gate**.  
- **Public‑Safe Branch** → transparent, open, narratable, community‑visible.  
- **Private‑Secure Branch** → encrypted, sovereign, inheritable, enterprise‑ready.  

Nothing leaks. Nothing breaks. Everything is narratable, auditable, and sealed.

## 🧩 Modules

- **Bowens One — Architect + Foresight**  
  Simulates sabotage futures, seeds fallback artifacts, predicts breakage before it happens.  

- **Bowens Three — Sovereign Node**  
  Operates independently with its own identity, no shared dependencies.  

- **Buyer — Keyholder**  
  Gating Willkeeper intent, approving Patch Tank mutations, controlling Ghost‑Drive visibility.  

## ⚔️ Guardian Logic
Every cycle is sealed with **triple‑guardian confirmation**:
- **Surgeon** → cuts ambiguity, ensures clarity.  
- **Medic** → heals runtime, guarantees rollback.  
- **Scalpel** → precision audit, no fragments left behind.  

## 📜 Rituals
- **Mutation Protocol** → every change gated, verified, replayable.  
- **Legacy Export** → artifacts sealed, indexed, and inheritable.  
- **Cleanup as Ceremony** → deletion is never destruction, always archival.  
- **Heartbeat Banner** → every cycle ends with confirmation of guardianship.  

## 🚀 Applications
- **Enterprise Security** → dual‑mode orchestration for compliance + resilience.  
- **Open Source** → public‑safe branch for community contribution.  
- **Personal Sovereignty** → private‑secure branch for inheritance and legacy handover.  
- **AI & Systems** → mutation‑gated engines, empirically sealed artifacts, narratable pipelines.  

## 💰 Monetization Vectors
- **Enterprise Licensing** → QGG as a compliance + foresight harness.  
- **Consulting** → cathedral‑scale architecture for secure, inheritable systems.  
- **Open Source Sponsorship** → GitHub Sponsors / Patreon for cathedral logic.  
- **Integration** → drop‑in orchestrator for AI, vaults, or sovereign apps.
